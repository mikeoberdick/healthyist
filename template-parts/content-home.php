				<h2 class = "text-center">Weight Loss Done Wrong is Killing You</h2>
				<p>For most of you who have tried losing excess body fat, you know from experience that the usual advice out there -- cut the calories and exercise more; no/low carbs; no/low fat -- does not work in the long run.  You've forced your body to lose some pounds over one week or a few by following that advice, and/or perhaps even trying "weight loss pills."  Then you gain back the pounds again a month or so later.  With every weight-loss weight-gain cycle, you are worse off than you were before; you've harmed your body and your psyche.</p>

			<div class="mb-5">
				<h2 class = "text-center">Weight Gain -- Consequences Not So Good</h2>
				<p>Your experience with weight gain and being chronically overweight is usually evidence of not-healthy lifestyle behaviors AND is an invitation for chronic life debilitating conditions including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, stroke, metabolic syndrome, obesity, and loss of normal mobility due to joint deterioration.</p>
				<p>And the likely consequences of such chronic disease are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Your life ending sooner than later.</li>
					<li>While living, to experience a lower quality of life, and possibly lowering life quality for family if they have to care for you.</li>
					<li>Experiencing significantly higher healthcare costs that can destroy your and your family's finances.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="mb-5">
				<h2 class="text-center">If You Really Care</h2>
				<p>There is a real solution, however.  For most people being overweight and its associated consequences can be prevented AND reversed by choosing to adopt a safe, practical, doable, medically-smart healthy lifestyle behaviors as guided by Healthyist.</p>
				<p>Healthyist is different from anything you've experienced; and necessarily so.</p>
				<p>Healthyist is based on current good science -- food, biology, chemistry, and behavioral.  Healthyist steps away from teh world of weight loss misinformation and enduring fallacies that misdirect most people including "weight loss experts" and well intentioned physicians.</p>

				<h2 class="text-center">Healthyist -- The Program</h2>

				<ul>
					<li>Why 25 weeks?  It takes time to truly adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors.  There is NO short cut.</li>
					<li>Why six behavior areas?  These life behaviors interact to affect our body's hormonal systems that then affect many body processes that affect weight control.  Healthyist is as simple and effective as possible.  There is NO short cut.</li>
